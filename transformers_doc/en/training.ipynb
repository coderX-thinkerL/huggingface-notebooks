It reduces computation costs, your carbon footprint, and allows you to use state-of-the-art models without having to train one from scratch. 🤗 Transformers provides access to thousands of pretrained models for a wide range of tasks. When you use a pretrained model, you train it on a dataset specific to your task. This is known as fine-tuning, an incredibly powerful training technique.

I had to force myself in front of a cashier who opened his register to wait on the person BEHIND me. I waited over five minutes for a gigantic order that included precisely one kid\\'s meal. After watching two people who ordered after me be handed their food, I asked where mine was. The manager started yelling at the cashiers for \\\\\"serving off their orders\\\\\" when they didn\\'t have their food. But neither cashier was anywhere near those controls, and the manager was the one serving food to customers and clearing the boards.\\\\nThe manager was rude when giving me my order. She didn\\'t make sure that I had everything ON MY RECEIPT, and never even had the decency to apologize that I felt I was getting poor service.\\\\nI\\'ve eaten at various McDonalds restaurants for over 30 years. I\\'ve worked at more than one location. I expect bad days, bad moods, and the occasional mistake. But I have yet to have a decent experience at this store. It will remain a place I avoid unless someone in my party needs to avoid illness from low blood sugar. Perhaps I should go back to the racially biased service of Steak n Shake instead!'}"

        "   - **定义：** 优化器是用于调整模型参数以最小化（或最大化）损失函数的算法。它根据模型的输出和真实标签之间的差异来更新模型参数，使模型的性能逐渐提升。\n",
        "   - **作用：** 优化器决定了模型如何根据损失函数的梯度更新权重。一些常见的优化算法包括梯度下降（Gradient Descent）、随机梯度下降（Stochastic Gradient Descent，SGD）、Adam、Adagrad 等。\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **学习率（Learning Rate）**：\n",
        "   - **定义：** 学习率是优化算法中的一个超参数，它决定了在每次参数更新中保留多少之前的权重更新。学习率越大，参数更新的幅度越大；学习率越小，模型参数更新的步幅越小。\n",
        "   - **作用：** 适当的学习率对于模型的训练非常关键。太大的学习率可能导致模型在损失函数中震荡或不收敛，而太小的学习率可能使训练过于缓慢或陷入局部最小值。\n",
        "\n",
        "在训练过程中，你需要选择一个合适的优化器和学习率，以确保模型能够有效地学习数据的模式并收敛到合适的参数值。这通常需要根据具体的任务、模型结构和数据集进行调试和调整。很多深度学习框架提供了各种不同的优化器和调整学习率的策略，让用户能够方便地配置这些超参数。"
